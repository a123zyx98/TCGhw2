Theory of Computer Game homework 2
This is a homework project for "Theory of Computer Game" at NTU CSIE.
I have to write a program that plays 9*9 Go with Monte-Carlo game tree search techniques. The purpose of this homework is to ask me to master the basic techniques of Monte-Carlo tree search, not to test efforts in designing GUI.
